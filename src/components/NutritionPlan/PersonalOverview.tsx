                  Losing weight requires creating a <b>calorie deficit</b>. To
                  achieve this, you must consume fewer calories than your body
                  burns. The amount of calories you burn in a day is known as
                  your total daily energy expenditure (TDEE). Your TDEE has been
                  calculated to be <b>{TDEE}</b>. This calculation is based on
                  factors such as your age, sex, weight, height, and activity
                  level. To lose weight, you must consume fewer calories than
                  your TDEE. A safe and sustainable rate of weight loss is
